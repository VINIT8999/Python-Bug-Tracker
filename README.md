# Console-Based Bug Tracker (Python)

## Description
This is a simple **console-based bug tracker built in Python** as a beginner learning project.  
The goal is to practice Python fundamentals like **dictionaries, lists, loops, and functions** while building a small, real-world inspired program.

The tracker lets you:
- Log new bugs with a title, status, description, and priority  
- View all existing bugs  
- Update descriptions for existing bugs  
- Add multiple bugs in one run

All data is stored in memory using **nested dictionaries**, keeping the code clean and easy to understand. This project focuses on **learning and practice**, not production use.
